# Download Dataset
Since the dataset is huge. I'm not uploading it here. Here's how to set it up:
1. Go to the [official Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg?resourcekey=0-rJlzl934LzC-Xp28GeIBzQ&usp=share_link)
2. Download `img_align_celeba_png.7z`
3. Unzip this file
4. Put it in `./data/`
5. Ultimately your images should be in `./data/img_align_celeba/` where `./` is your project root directory
